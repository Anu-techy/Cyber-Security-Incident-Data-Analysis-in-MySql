# Cyber-Security-Incident-Data-Analysis-in-MySql

**Problem Statement**

Security teams rely on dashboards for situational awareness, but the fast-evolving nature of cyber incident data demands deeper analysis 
to uncover the drivers behind observed trends to make strategic decisions.

**Goal of the Analysis**

1. Perform basic data exploration.
2. Conduct data validation to ensure accuracy of Power BI KPIs
3. Deliver Ad hoc Reports using advanced SQL querying.
4. Develop reusable backend logic using MySQL

**Steps of Analysis**

1. Data Exploration And Data Validation
2. Generated Report to display the incident details with top Loss amount in each year
3. Generated Report to display the cumulative Loss over Time for long-term risk exposure and budget planning.
4. Created stored procedure for validating Percentage Change in  Loss amounts And Incident_counts with respect to the given years
5. Created Stored Procedure to display the Chosen Criteria name [City, Category, Incident_Type]  with its highest total loss in each year using Dynamic Sql.
6. Created a View to reference report of ‘emerging cyber threats’ frequently.
   The report displays Incident Types, their first and recent occurrence dates along with Category and City.
 
**Recommendations:**

The Analysis ensured the accuracy and consistency of data reflected in visual dashboards.

Incident Lifecycle and trend reports helped identify emerging threats enabling proactive mitigation strategies.

Executive summaries and high-loss incident reports provided clear visibility into critical events, supporting prioritization of security investments.

Cumulative loss analysis over time highlighted the long-term financial impact of incidents, justifying the need for sustained cybersecurity funding.

**What I learnt**

Learned to ask the right analytical questions to guide focused, purpose-driven data exploration.

Developed advanced SQL skills to extract deeper insights beyond what dashboards typically provide.

Gained foundational domain knowledge in cybersecurity, including threat types, risk patterns.

Enhanced data storytelling and communication skills to present findings in a clear, concise, and impactful manner for stakeholders.
